'''Random Numbers (and Modules)
This is using Python code that somebody else wrote. 
In Python, these formally-distributed code packages are called modules.
The thing we want from a module in this exercise is the ability to generate random numbers. 
This comes from the random module'''

#Generate a random number between 1 and 9.

import random

num = random.randint(1,9)

print(num)
